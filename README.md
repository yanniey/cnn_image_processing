## A list of deep learning projects that I've worked on with CNN (Convolutional neural network).

Written in Jupyter notebook and models are run on AWS Cloud :sunglasses:

1. [Image processing with scikit-image](https://github.com/yanniey/cnn_image_processing/blob/master/Step1_loading_and_manipulating_image_data.ipynb)
	* Masking & Image Manipulation
	* Block views & Pooling (Max/Mean/Median)
	* Contour Detection
	* Convex Hull
	* Edge detection using Roberts, Sobel and Canny edge detectors


	To be continued:
	* Object and Feature Detection
	* Segmentation and Transformation
