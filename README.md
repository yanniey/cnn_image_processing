## A list of deep learning projects that I've worked on with CNN (Convolutional neural network).

Written in Jupyter notebook and models are run on AWS Cloud :sunglasses:

1. [Pluralsight course: Building Image Processing Applications Using scikit-image](https://github.com/yanniey/cnn_image_processing/blob/master/Step1_loading_and_manipulating_image_data.ipynb)
	1. Masking & Image Manipulation
        * Block views & Pooling (Max/Mean/Median)
        * Contour Detection
        * Convex Hull
        * Edge detection using Roberts, Sobel and Canny edge detectors
	2. Image Descriptors
        1. SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature Transform)
        2. DAISY descriptors
        3. HOG descriptor (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
    3. Corner Detection
    4. Denoising Filters
        1. Total variation filter: based on the principal that signals with noise have high total variation
        2. Bilateral filter: good at preserving edges
        3. Wavelet denoising filter: good at preserving image quality
    5. Morphological reconstruction
        1. Erosion (to find holes in image)
        2. Dilation (to find peaks in image)
    6. Thresholding

	To be continued:
	* Segmentation and Transformation
